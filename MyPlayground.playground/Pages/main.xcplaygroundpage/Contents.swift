/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function named `frozen` which takes no arguments. When this function is called, it prints "Let it go!".
 */
// write your code here
func frozen() {
    print("Let it go!")
}

frozen()





/*: question2
 ### 2. Write a function named `frozenAgain` that takes no arguments. Declare a constant in the body of the function, and assign it the value "Let it go!". Then print it to the console.
 */
// write your code here
func frozenAgain() {
    let song=("Let it go!")
    print(song)
}
frozenAgain()






/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes in a character's name as an argument (it can be any character from anything). What should the type of that argument be? Print the message "My favorite character is <character name>." to the screen.
 */
func favCharacter(char: String) {
    print("My favorite character is \(char)")
}
favCharacter(char: "Shrek")






/*: question4
 ### 4. Call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a constant you define. Then call it using a variable. Change the value of the variable, and call it again. What do you see in the console?
 */
// write your code here
let char1 = "Tucan"
favCharacter(char: char1)

var char2 = "sam"
favCharacter(char: char2)

char2 = "tam"
favCharacter(char: char2)





/*: question5
 ### 5. Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and prints the string "I got <number> problems but Swift ain't one" to the console.
 */
// write your code here
func probs(problems: Int) {
    print("I got \(problems) problems but Swift ain't one")
}

probs(problems: 4)





/*: question6
 ### 6. Write a function that takes two arguments, the name of a band (a `String`) and a number (an `Int`). It should print the message "My #<number> favorite band is <band>." to the console.
 */
// write your code here
func favband(band: String, number: Int) {
    print("My #\(number) favorite band is \(band).")
}
favband(band: "Ariana", number: 2)






/*: question7
 ### 7. The code below is broken. Can you identify which line has an error and fix it so that it works again? Uncomment the code below before starting.
 */
func badFavoriteBand(bandName: String, position: Int) {
   print("My #\(position) favorite band is \(bandName).")
}

badFavoriteBand(bandName: "The Beatles", position: 2)







/*: question8
 ### 8. This code is broken, too. Assume the call to the function is correct. What's broken about the function definition? Can you fix it? Uncomment the code below before starting.
 */
func alsoBadFavoriteBand(bandName: String, position: Int) {
    print("My #\(position) favorite band is \(bandName)")
}

alsoBadFavoriteBand(bandName: "Blink-182", position: 42)







/*: question9
 ### 9. Let's play Mad Libs! Create a function called `madLib`. It should take three parameters: A character name, a noun, and a preposition, and print out the line "To <noun> and <preposition>, <character name>!" to the console. Don't forget to call your function to test it out!
 */
// write your code here
func madLib(name: String, noun: String, prep: String) {
    print("To \(noun) and \(prep), \(name)!")
}
madLib(name: "Andy", noun: "infinifty", prep: "beyond")





/*: question10
 ### 10. Create a function that takes no arguments and returns the string "Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!"
 */
// write your code here
func buzz() {
        print("Buzz Lightyear to the rescue!")

}


buzz()




/*: question11
 ### 11. Create a function that takes no arguments and returns any number.
 */
// write your code here
func number() {
    print(42)
}

number()


/*: question12
 ### 12. Create a function that takes in a characters name. This function will return back a `String` as follows: "To infinity and beyond, <character name>!". The character name should be returned uppercased.
 */
// write your code here
func beyond(name: String) {
    let upperName = name.uppercased()
    print("To infinity and beyond, \(upperName)!")
}

beyond(name: "Hannah")
