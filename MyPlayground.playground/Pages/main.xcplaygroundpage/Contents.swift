/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function named `frozen` which takes no arguments. When this function is called, it prints "Let it go!".
 */
func frozen() {
    print("Let it go!")
}








/*: question2
 ### 2. Write a function named `frozenAgain` that takes no arguments. Declare a constant in the body of the function, and assign it the value "Let it go!". Then print it to the console.

    let song = "Let it go!"
    print(song)
}

 ### 3. Write a function that takes in a character's name as an argument (it can be any character from anything). What should the type of that argument be? Print the message "My favorite character is <character name>." to the screen.
 */
func character(_ name: String) {
    print("My favorite character is \(name).")
}







/*: question4
 ### 4. Call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a constant you define. Then call it using a variable. Change the value of the variable, and call it again. What do you see in the console?
 */
character("Elsa")
character("Ana")







/*: question5
 ### 5. Write a function that takes an integer as an argument and prints the string "I got <number> problems but Swift ain't one" to the console.
 */
func problems(_ num: Int) {
    print("I got \(num) problems but Swift ain't one")
}








/*: question6

 */
func bands(_ band: String, _ num: Int) {
    print("My #/(num) favorite band is \(band).")

    print("My #\(position) favorite band is \(bandName).")
}

badFavoriteBand(bandName: "The Beatles", position: 2)







/*: question8
 ### 8. This code is broken, too. Assume the call to the function is correct. What's broken about the function definition? Can you fix it? Uncomment the code below before starting.

    print("My #\(position) favorite band is \(bandName)")
}
